### Hi! I'm Markus ðŸ‘‹

# I help companies design and deliver digital products faster.

Doing so, I like well written CSS. Working with designers and frontend developers. Creating design systems. Caring for a smooth workflow for my team. Exploring new technologies.

Apart from that, I like my family. Ice cream. Netflix. Kettlebells. Yoga.
