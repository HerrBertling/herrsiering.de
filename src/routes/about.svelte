<h1>What I am currently doing</h1>

<section>

<h2>Family</h2>
<p>Like so many others, I'm a very, <i>very</i> proud dad. It's so much fun watching a child grow up, exploring the world and finding wonders in the tiniest things we grownups take for granted.</p>

<h2>Playing around</h2>

<p>I built this website about a year ago. Used Vuepress, a custom theme for it. And quite a lot of CSS Grid magic to arrange the content. Inspect it. Check out the <a href="http://github.com/herrBertling/herrsiering.de/">repo</a>. Tell me what I could do better <a href="https://twitter.com/HerrBertling/">on Twitter</a>!</p>

<p>Besides that, I'm spending most of my free time to play with my daughter rather than with technology. Thankfully, I get to explore a lot of technology at work üòä</p>

<p>Things I think about a lot currently:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to build themeable components.</li>
<li>How to best make components available for different projects. Vue + CSS Custom Properties + Web Components sounds like I <a href="https://twitter.com/HerrBertling/status/1164191715563114496">should explore that</a>.</li>
<li>How to use what I know and apply it to climate change.</li>
<li>How to get my daughter to be still for diaper changes. Which frankly is the most complicated thing I think about right now üòÖ</li>
</ul>

<h2>Work</h2>

<p>I work as a UI Engineer at sum.cumo GmbH. Yes. No Senior. We don't do career levels. I get my first gray hairs, though. And do awful dad jokes.</p>

<p>So just consider me being senior anyways.</p>

<p><strong>Buzzwords</strong>: Vue, Components, Frontend Architecture, Storybook</p>

<h1>What I did earlier</h1>

<section>

<h2>Senior UI Engineer at XING SE</h2>

<h3>01/2017 ‚Äì 07/2018</h3>

<p>In a fantastic team, I helped build a web design system for more than 40 product teams. We built up a library of over 60 components. It includes contribution guidelines and extensive documentation for the whole design system. I was lucky to work with awesome people like <a href="https://twitter.com/dmbch">Daniel</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/yanwalton">Yan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinDrexler">Robin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/aithir">Matthias</a>.</p>

<h2>UI Engineer at Jimdo GmbH</h2>

<h3>07/2015 - 12/2016</h3>

<p>My last position at Jimdo was UI Engineer. A designer from a product team decided to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVvmYZPWO1g">hike across the Alps</a>, so I filled in his position. Four weeks later, we had rolled out a new Corporate Identity into the product. And we decided that I'd stay with the product team from that point on.</p>

<p>I worked on the UI Library that <a href="https://afknapping.de/">Fabian</a> had kickstarted with an innocent button component. With the code, design and process superpowers of <a href="https://schubrake.de/">Lasse and Hannes</a>, the library became ever more useful. Later on, it formed the foundation for the rebuilt website administration.</p>

<h2>Template Daddy at Jimdo GmbH</h2>

<h3>03/2014 - 07/2015</h3>

<p>In my former position, I gathered quite some knowledge about how HTML/CSS and templates work at Jimdo. Building up templates for a new system felt pretty natural to me and the leadership team. That system worked in a completely different way compared to the one used back then within the Jimdo CMS.</p>

<p>I build up the team and templates together with <a href="https://www.jillheyer.com/">Jill</a>, having loads of fun and learning a lot while doing that.</p>

<h2>Partner Geek at Jimdo GmbH</h2>

<h3>01/2012 - 02/2014</h3>

<p>I started at Jimdo working in the Partner Team with the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/hendricruesch">Hendric</a>. I cared about the relationships with affiliate partners and build up the network of <a href="https://experts.jimdo.com/">Jimdo Experts</a>. They provided special services for Jimdo users. And I provided special support for their HTML/CSS needs üòä</p>

<h2>Intern, Trainee & Junior Technical Project Manager at achtung! GmbH</h2>

<h3>06/2010 - 12/2011</h3>

<p>From starting as an intern until being a Junior PM for all technical parts of a project, I helped various client teams bring their social media ideas from concept into the browser. On the way, I helped designers and (external) developers to communicate in a better way with each other.</p>

<h2>Communications Science at WWU M√ºnster</h2>

<h3>10/2005 - 02/2011</h3>

<p>I mostly code by now, though originally I studied communication science at the <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/Kowi/">IfK M√ºnster</a>. While I chose the theoretical side of the studies, I gained a lot of practical knowledge at <a href="https://campusrelations.jimdo.com/">campus relations</a>, a group of students offering public relations work for local businesses in M√ºnster.</p>

<p>Next to that, I worked for <a href="https://www.pr-ip.de/">primus inter pares</a>, a dedicated team of communication specialists. I did everything from writing press releases to building WordPress websites.</p>
