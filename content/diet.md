# Diet Principles

Concerning food, I’m as much an expert as you are. Recently, I read a summary of [“Food Rules: An Eater’s Manual”](https://amzn.to/320yIhj) by Michael Pollan. The one memorable sentence from it is:

> Eat food, not too much, mostly plants.

## Eat food

That means: Not food-like substances. Luckily, it’s rather easy to find this kind of food around my office. It’s even easier to get this done at home. Mostly, it’s some falafel, ramen or a mix of beans and veggies at my currently [favorite vegan restaurant](https://www.appleeve.de).

Okay, sometimes, I do eat a Beyond Meat burger, but at least that’s still vegan :smile:

## Not too much

Yeah, working on that. Ice cream doesn’t count, right?

## Mostly plants

I eat vegan food as much as possible. I don’t go to great lengths to make sure everything is vegan, though. If I can only get a vegetarian option when I’m out, I’m fine with that. At home, though, it’s easy (yes, easy) to stick to a vegan diet.

For breakfast, for example, I prepare a mix for overnight oats about every three weeks:

- Oats or spelt as base
- Flax seeds
- Chia seeds
- Psyllium husk (yes, I googled that. Flohsamenschalen in german)
- Grated coconut
- Crushed almonds
- Goji berries

Six tablespoons of that in a water glass, some kind of vegan milk on top, some blueberries on top. Done. I don’t think about this anymore. I just eat it and am fine until lunch. Simple.
