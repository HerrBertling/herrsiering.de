# What I am currently doing

<article>

## Family

Like so many others, I'm a very, _very_ proud dad since February 2019. It's so much fun watching a child grow up, exploring the world and finding wonders in the tiniest things we grownups take for granted.

## Work

I work as a UI Engineer at sum.cumo GmbH. Yes. No Senior. We don't do career levels. I get my first gray hairs, though. And do awful dad jokes.

So just consider me being senior anyways.

**Buzzwords**: Vue, Components, Frontend Architecture, Storybook

## Playing around

I built this website about a year ago. Used Vuepress, a custom theme for it. And quite a lot of CSS Grid magic to arrange the content. Inspect it. Check out the [repo](http://github.com/herrBertling/herrsiering.de/). Tell me what I could do better [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/HerrBertling/)!

Besides that, I'm spending most of my free time to play with my daughter rather than with technology. Thankfully, I get to explore a lot of technology at work :blush:

Things I think about a lot currently:

- How to build themeable components.
- How to best make components available for different projects. Vue + CSS Custom Properties + Web Components sounds like I [should explore that](https://twitter.com/HerrBertling/status/1164191715563114496).
- How to use what I know and apply it to climate change.
- How to get my daughter to be still for diaper changes. Which frankly is the most complicated thing I think about right now :smile:

# What I did earlier

## Senior UI Engineer at XING SE

### 01/2017 ‚Äì 07/2018

In a fantastic team, I helped build a web design system for more than 40 product teams. We built up a library of over 60 components. It includes contribution guidelines and extensive documentation for the whole design system. I was lucky to work with awesome people like [Daniel](https://twitter.com/dmbch), [Yan](https://twitter.com/yanwalton), [Robin](https://twitter.com/RobinDrexler/) and [Matthias](https://twitter.com/aithir).

## UI Engineer at Jimdo GmbH

### 07/2015 - 12/2016

My last position at Jimdo was UI Engineer. A designer from a product team decided to [hike across the Alps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVvmYZPWO1g), so I filled in his position. Four weeks later, we had rolled out a new Corporate Identity into the product. And we decided that I'd stay with the product team from that point on.

I worked on the UI Library that [Fabian](https://afknapping.de/) had kickstarted with an innocent button component. With the code, design and process superpowers of [Lasse and Hannes](https://mutualistic.systems/), the library became ever more useful. Later on, it formed the foundation for the rebuilt website administration.

## Template Daddy at Jimdo GmbH

### 03/2014 - 07/2015

In my former position, I gathered quite some knowledge about how HTML/CSS and templates work at Jimdo. Building up templates for a new system felt pretty natural to me and the leadership team. That system worked in a completely different way compared to the one used back then within the Jimdo CMS.

I build up the team and templates together with [Jill](https://www.jillheyer.com/), having loads of fun and learning a lot while doing that.

**Buzzwords**: Team building, LESS, Sass, communication

## Partner Geek at Jimdo GmbH

### 01/2012 - 02/2014

I started at Jimdo working in the Partner Team with the awesome [Hendric](https://twitter.com/hendricruesch). I cared about the relationships with affiliate partners and build up the network of [Jimdo Experts](https://experts.jimdo.com/). They provided special services for Jimdo users. And I provided special support for their HTML/CSS needs üòä

## Intern, Trainee & Junior Technical Project Manager at achtung! GmbH

### 06/2010 - 12/2011

From starting as an intern until being a Junior PM for all technical parts of a project, I helped various client teams bring their social media ideas from concept into the browser. On the way, I helped designers and (external) developers to communicate in a better way with each other.

## Communications Science at WWU M√ºnster

### 10/2005 - 02/2011

I mostly code by now, though originally I studied communication science at the [IfK M√ºnster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Kowi/). While I chose the theoretical side of the studies, I gained a lot of practical knowledge at [campus relations](https://campusrelations.jimdo.com/), a group of students offering public relations work for local businesses in M√ºnster.

Next to that, I worked for [primus inter pares](https://www.pr-ip.de/), a small, dedicated team of communication specialists. I did everything from writing press releases to building WordPress websites.
