# Books I _have_ and you _should_ read

<article>

## The Road Less Traveled

A wonderful book about how life works and how you might approach it:

> Life is difficult. This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths. It is a great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it. Once we truly know that life is difficult-once we truly understand and accept it-then life is no longer difficult. Because once it is accepted, the fact that life is difficult no longer matters.

I re-read it about every two years.

## Man's Search for Meaning

This book helped a lot with setting things that happen in my life into perspective. Also, I love this bit:

> Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.

## The Achievment Habit

Same as with Man's Search for Meaning and The Road Less Traveled, this book is a great read about how to appoach life. I loved the part about being right or wrong:

> Whenever I find myself challenged to a game of right and wrong, I stop playing. Next time you find yourself playing right and wrong, remember. You give everything in your life its meaning, so you can choose to end the game. It does not matter how right you are or how wrong they are; you lose just by playing.
