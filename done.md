#### Senior UI Engineer at XING SE

In a fantastic team, I helped build a web design system for more than 40 product teams. We build up a library of over 60 components, contribution guidelines and extensive documentation for the whole design system. I was lucky to work with awesome people like [Daniel](https://twitter.com/dmbch), [Robin](https://twitter.com/RobinDrexler/) and [Matthias](https://twitter.com/aithir).

### 07/2015 - 12/2016

#### UI Engineer at Jimdo GmbH

My last position at Jimdo was UI Engineer. A designer from a product team decided to [hike across the Alps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVvmYZPWO1g), so someone (me!) filled in his position in said product team. Four weeks later, Jimdo had a new Corporate Identity introduced and the team decided to not let me go back to the Template Team again.

From that point on, I worked on the Jimdo system and most of the time on the UI Library that [Fabian](https://afknapping.de/) had kickstarted with an innocent button component. With the code, design and process superpowers of [Lasse and Hannes](https://mutualistic.systems/), we formed the Jimdo UI Library to be the foundation for the newly built website administration.

### 03/2014 - 07/2015

#### Template Daddy at Jimdo GmbH

Since I had quite some knowledge about how HTML/CSS and templates work at Jimdo (see below), I was tasked with building up templates for a new template system. That system worked in a completely different way compared to the one used back then within the Jimdo CMS.

I build up the team together with [Jill](https://www.jillheyer.com/), having loads of fun and learning a lot while doing that.

### 01/2012 - 02/2014

#### Partner Geek at Jimdo GmbH

I started at Jimdo working in the Partner Team with the awesome [Hendric](https://twitter.com/hendricruesch). I cared about the relationships with affiliate partners and most importantly build up the network of "Jimdo Experts". They provided special services for Jimdo users. And I provided special support for their HTML/CSS needs üòä

#### Intern, Trainee & Junior Technical Project Manager at achtung! GmbH

From starting as an intern until being a Junior PM for all technical parts of a project, I helped various client teams bring their social media ideas from concept into the browser. On the way, I helped designers and (external) developers to communicate in a better way with each other.

### 10/2005 - 02/2011

#### Communications Science at WWU M√ºnster

While I mostly code by now, I originally studied communication science at the [IfK M√ºnster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Kowi/). While I chose the theoretical side of the studies, I gained a lot of practical knowledge being engaged in [campus relations](https://campusrelations.jimdo.com/), a group of students offering public relations work for local businesses in M√ºnster.

Next to that, I worked for [primus inter pares](https://www.pr-ip.de/), a small, dedicated team of communication specialists. I did everything from writing press releases to building WordPress websites.
