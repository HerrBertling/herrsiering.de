# Hi! I'm Markus ðŸ‘‹

## I help companies design and deliver digital products faster.

Doing so, I like well written CSS. Working with designers and frontend developers. Creating design systems. Caring for a smooth workflow for my team. Exploring new technologies.

Apart from that, I like my family. Ice cream. Netflix. Kettlebells. Yoga.

## The technical stuff, if you want toâ€¦

0. `git cloneâ€¦` + `cdâ€¦` (you know the drill.)
1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev`
3. ???
4. Profit! ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°
