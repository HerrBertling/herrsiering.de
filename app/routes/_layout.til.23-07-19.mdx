## Generating a small Node script with ChatGPT

I was a bit bothered by the process of creating these TIL entries. So I figured
I could enhance it by
[automating the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).

Since it is 2023 and we are using AI to help us develop these types of scripts
faster since <s>years</s> months, I asked ChatGPT to help me:

```
I want you to write a script in NodeJS that I can call from a package.json –
in the end, I want to run `npm run scaffold-til` to kick off the process. It
is supposed to lead me through a short question/answer dialogue to scaffold a
new entry for the "today I learned" section of my website. The script should
to the following:

- Ask me for the title of today's "Today I learned" entry
- Add an entry to the beginning of an array in the file `app/data/tils.mjs` The
  file currently has this shape: […]
- Scaffold an MDX file within the `app/routes` folder with the naming scheme
  similar to this existing file: `_layout.til.23-07-18.mdx`
- Add the basic scaffold of the MDX file as it is formatted in this example:
  […]
```

It took a bit of back and forth to e.g. use `date-fns` instead of `moment` for
date formatting and get some minor things to work. But after a few minutes, this
entry was scaffolded with the title and date through
[this wonderful script](https://github.com/HerrBertling/herrsiering.de/tree/main/scripts/scaffoldTIL.mjs).
And it definitely took me less time than doing it on my own. Cool, eh?

Mandatory ending for entries like these:
