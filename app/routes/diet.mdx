# Diet Principles

Concerning food, I’m as much an expert as you are. Recently, I read a summary of
[“Food Rules: An Eater’s Manual”](https://amzn.to/320yIhj) by Michael Pollan.
The one memorable sentence from it is:

> Eat food, not too much, mostly plants.

## Eat food

That means: Not food-like substances. Luckily, it is rather easy to do this at home.
I either cook some HelloFresh stuff or simple vegan/vegetarian dishes.

Also, fermenting things is great and does wonders to your gut. I swear eating fermented food makes me happier as well.

## Not too much

Yeah, working on that. Ice cream doesn’t count, right? Since taking my workouts more serious, I started tracking my food via [Yazio](https://www.yazio.com) which works great and helped shed some kilos.

## Mostly plants

I eat vegan food as much as possible. I don’t go to great lengths to make sure
everything is vegan, though. If I can only get a vegetarian option when I’m out,
I’m fine with that. At home, though, it’s easy (yes, easy) to stick to a vegan
diet.

Frozen vegetables are also great to bump up the amount of fiber you eat – broccoli, mixed vegetables,… whatever it is. Quickly done and you can eat tons of it without taking in too many calories.
