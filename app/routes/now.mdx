# Now

## Family

Like so many others, I'm a very, _very_ proud dad. It's so much fun watching a
child grow up, exploring the world and finding wonders in the tiniest things we
grownups take for granted.

## Health

Going into spring, I started using my treadmill daily to get at least 10k steps in. I have a plan for kettlebell workouts as well:

- Until May: A few weeks of the Simple part of "Simple & Sinister"
- May: Four weeks of "The Giant 3.0"
- June: Switching between the "Armor Building Complex" and "Humane Burpee" for three workouts per week

Let's see where this takes me.

## Work

I decided to put all I've learned into fighting against climate change. I'm a
software developer by trade, so that means coding in a green tech startup. That
one is currently [zolar](https://zolar.de).

Next to that, I'm exploring Elixir and Phoenix out of sheer curiosity. I like the way Remix bridges the network gap for React apps, the environment I am most familiar with. Learning a new programming language, its different way of approaching problems and getting a new perspective on how you can build web apps is really refreshing.
