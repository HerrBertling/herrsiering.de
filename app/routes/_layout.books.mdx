# Books I really like

## The Road Less Traveled

A wonderful book about how life works and how you might approach it:

> Life is difficult. This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths. It is a
> great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it. Once we
> truly know that life is difficult-once we truly understand and accept it-then
> life is no longer difficult. Because once it is accepted, the fact that life
> is difficult no longer matters.

I re-read it about every two years.

## Man's Search for Meaning

This book helped a lot with setting things that happen in my life into
perspective. Also, I love this bit:

> Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to
> choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.

## The Achievement Habit

Same as with Man's Search for Meaning and The Road Less Traveled, this book is a
great read about how to appoach life. I loved the part about being right or
wrong:

> Whenever I find myself challenged to a game of right and wrong, I stop
> playing. Next time you find yourself playing right and wrong, remember. You
> give everything in your life its meaning, so you can choose to end the game.
> It does not matter how right you are or how wrong they are; you lose just by
> playing.

## The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\\\*ck

Mark Manson writes a **lot** of
[clever things](https://markmanson.net/how-to-grow-up). This book is no
exception. A lot of gems inside, here are a few from my Kindle highlights:

> To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain. In contrast, if
> you're able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable.

([Cold showers](/workout#take-cold-showers)! ðŸ˜…)

> Self-awareness is like an onion. There are multiple layers to it, and the more
> you peel them back, the more likely you're going to start crying at
> inappropriate times.

> You are already great because in the face of endless confusion and certain
> death, you continue to choose what to give a fuck about and what not to. This
> mere fact, this simple optioning for your own values in life, already makes
> you beautiful, already makes you successful, and already makes you loved.
