## @testing-library/user-event clipboard

While writing a test today for a rather simple "copy to clipboard" button, I learned that using the user-event package from `@testing-library` stubs the browser clipboard in a really nice way.

> Note that the Clipboard API is usually not available outside of secure context.
> To enable testing of workflows involving the clipboard, userEvent.setup() replaces window.navigator.clipboard with a stub.

Super helpful!
