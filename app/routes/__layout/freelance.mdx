# Freelancing

I'm based in Hamburg, Germany, working remotely since 2020. I've gained a ton of experience with agile methods, pair
programming, remote work and both product work and agency
projects. I've worked with some of Germany's biggest online businesses. I love bringing this experience into any new project.

Yours included.

**I'm available again from October 2022 on.**

## What other people say

> Markus helped us build a working prototype, where he was responsible for the UI and frontend. The result was not only good-looking, it worked like a charm. Thatâ€™s impressive given the super tight deadline. A lot of this work was done in pairing mode, and we were thankful for pleasant interactions and lots of knowledge transfer. We worked together for a second time, and I can hardly wait for the next mutual project.

I've been working as a frontend developer since 2015. Coming from writing HTML/CSS code, I've tried out quite a few things.

I've worked with React and VueJS, played with Svelte and web components. I've built and established design systems in React and VueJS.

I've established open source libraries instead of using costly in-house wheel reinventions. Ranging from brand new tech stacks to years old code bases, Iâ€™ve worked on all kinds of projects. Doing that, I've learned when to use frameworks and libraries and when to build your own solution. I created complicated frontends for insurances and lotteries in close communication with UX and design. I have written more TypeScript than I ever expected. More GraphQL, too.

You can throw any agile-ish working style at me because Iâ€™ve most certainly used and worked in it by now. If youâ€™re uncertain or unsatisfied with your current way of working, I can moderate a retrospective or help shape a better process. Another great tool I enjoy using are [Wardley Maps](https://medium.com/wardleymaps).

## Skills

I've written so much CSS in the last years that I'm by now able to write it without a dev server running. And still getting the results I need. I'd be open to working with React again. My love for VueJS is unbroken, though, so I'd be super happy to keep working with that.

I'm not afraid of jumping into other programming languages besides JavaScript. It will take some time to get up to speed in them, though.

## Remote

I will keep living in Hamburg, but I'm not bound to employers located in my current city. Throughout the pandemic, I've got used to working remotely. I'd love to meet colleagues from time to time in whichever way, so I'm open to doing off-site events, team huddles or whatever you fancy. Just don't keep me away from my family for too long, okay?

## Fun & side projects

I've built [a small machine learning app](https://github.com/HerrBertling/wireframe-to-code) as a hack week project.

I bootstrapped a [serverless email newsletter side project with the AWS CDK + Python](https://github.com/HerrBertling/swing-trading-newsletter-aws-cdk). I've automated transcriptions for my wife's podcast through a quick AWS Step Function + AWS Transcribe. I've provided a new website for [virtualsupporttalks.de](https://www.virtualsupporttalks.de/en/), a German initiative for mental health during the pandemic.

I've dabbled with web3 stuff. Results: A [simple Vue/Vite starter template](https://github.com/HerrBertling/simple-vite-eth) + an Ethereum [blockies implementation in Vue3](https://github.com/HerrBertling/vue-blockies)

I try to fix open source projects when I hit a wall or find a bug.

I've successfully avoided managing my own server, database or backend by using services like Netlify, Vercel, Contentful/GraphCMS, AWS Amplify and the AWS CDK.

Exploring new technologies is a lot of fun for me. I even read documentation to solve issues ðŸ˜… And I somehow manage to get up and running with most of these things quickly. I've started looking into Rust. That's a frightening thing, coming from CSS. I'm drawn towards learning it anyway, and can't yet explain why that is.

If I attend a (un-)conference or meetup, I try to come up with a talk I could hold. Iâ€™ve shared knowledge at various barcamps, meetups and at the JSUnconf Hamburg. Internally, I did the same at every company Iâ€™ve worked at so far.
