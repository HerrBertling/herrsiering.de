# Now

## Family

Like so many others, I'm a very, _very_ proud dad. It's so much fun watching a
child grow up, exploring the world and finding wonders in the tiniest things we
grownups take for granted.

## Health

I had a broken toe, healing that took more weeks than I expected. I'm slowly
getting back into shape by using both Easy Strength and [GMB.io](https://gmb.io)
workouts.

## Work

I decided to put all I've learned into fighting against climate change. I'm a
software developer by trade, so that means coding in a green tech startup. That
one is currently [zolar](https://zolar.de).
