## Naming AWS resources is against best practices, apparently

I worked on some AWS CDK stuff today and ran into a few problems of the same
shape. Some resource could not be created because I already had a resource with
that name in the stack.

After a bit of googling, I found
[a comment in the aws-cdk repo issues](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/16686#issuecomment-938135845)
outlining what went wrong.

I had happily added a custom name to both a S3 bucket and a CloudFront
OriginRequestPolicy â€“ a simple copy&paste "this will do" error as I took the CDK
template for a Remix app
[from here](https://github.com/florianwiech/remix-aws-cdk-example/blob/main/infrastructure/lib/remix-stack.ts)

The template absolutely works for one deployment of one stack. But with handling
different environments, the static names for these resources do not work. As
lined out in the issue:

> Assigning physical names to resources has some disadvantages in AWS
> CloudFormation. Most importantly, any changes to deployed resources that
> require a resource replacement, such as changes to a resource's properties
> that are immutable after creation, will fail if a resource has a physical name
> assigned.

The best part: I can simply remove the custom name and the naming is done
automagically. How nice is that?

Well, now I know.
