      For a silly thing I built a tiny React component to easily send a
      pre-filled tweet. I thought I might as well share it.

# A simple "tweet this" React component

While I was playing around with my website, I noticed that I hadn't set up a
proper error page yet. Since this is a website made out of MDX files, the worst
and only case probably is a `404` error.

Reading the Remix docs on the
[`CatchBoundary`](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/not-found#root-catch-boundary),
I figured I could make the 404 page more fun. Why not have people shout at me on
Twitter if a page is missing? I mean… that's what Twitter is made for, right?

It's surprisingly easy to create a link that prefills the tweet text for people.

Here's the code:

```tsx
import type { ReactNode } from "react";

export default function TwitterPrefilledTextLink({
  tweetText,
  children,
}: {
  tweetText: string;
  children: ReactNode;
}) {
  const encodedTweetText = encodeURIComponent(tweetText);
  const link = `https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=${encodedTweetText}`;
  return (
    <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href={link}>
      {children}
    </a>
  );
}
```

The one part that's interesting here is probably the `encodeURIComponent` – it
ensures a properly encoded tweet text. The rest is… well, a link.

Have fun with it!
