# Kettlebell tips for beginners

Since quite some people asked me about how to start working out with
kettlebells, I figured I shouldn't bury that advice in Twitter direct messages
or WhatsApp messages. Here we go.

## Preparation

You should definitely check out Tim Anderson and his
"[Original Strength](https://originalstrength.net)". He provides a _lot_ of
workouts and stretches in his
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/OriginalStrengthSys) as well.
This has nothing to do with kettlebells per se, but it will prepare your body
and overall movement patterns for kettlebell training.

His book
"[Pressing Reset: Original Strength reloaded](https://lesen.amazon.de/kp/embed?asin=B07BH358BG&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_HYWFZC0F75VTQXPB2E5S&tag=amazon0815hb-21)"
is co-written by Geoff Neupert whom I'll mention again further down. Read it. Do
the strength reset daily or as a warmup for your strength training.

You can also do two of the most simple kettlebell movements that require not
_that_ much technique: The Goblet Squat and Kettlebell Carries. Carries are as
simple as you can imagine: Pick up your kettlebell with alternating hands and
walk â€“ 10, 15, 20 minutes. Your abdominals and your grip strength will thank
you.

## Which kettlebell, which weight should you use?

When I started out with kettlebell workouts, I bought some cheap ones via Amazon
â€“ plastic coating, concrete (or something) as the core. They were way too big
for the respective weight, always felt "off" and the plastic grip with its seams
ruined my hands all the time.

So I switched to quality kettlebells I could use forever. They are more
expensive, but if you've ever signed up for a gym membership â€“ it's cheaper and
you'll actually do something with your body ðŸ˜„ Since I'm in Germany, I bought
from
[kettlebellshop.de](http://kettlebellshop.de/16kg-dragon-door-military-grade-rkc-kettlebell-38mm-standard)
â€“ the link leads to the initial 16kg kettlebell I'd recommend for men getting
started.

Anything below 16kg is probably too light for you after four to eight weeks. By
now I own two of these plus a 24kg one.

## Getting started with your kettlebell strength practice

I first started reading
"[Simple & Sinister](https://lesen.amazon.de/kp/embed?asin=B07ZQKWMKR&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_PKEFRWFQP0FQK5RY2BWE&tag=amazon0815hb-21)"
by Pavel. He's a manly man, so prepare for that kind of style. I also took part
in a beginner workshop with
[Frank from Hamburg Kettlebell Club](https://hamburg-kettlebell-club.de) here in
Hamburg.

You really want to nail your technique before picking up any weight. Especially
the kettlebell swing can ruin your back. So please, please take some money and
have a professional teach you.

A great online forum for advice if you're unsure is hosted by
[StrongFirst](https://strongfirst.com/community/forums/kettlebell/). You can get
feedback from fantastic people who absolutely know what they're talking about.
Feel free to post a form check there, the feedback will be honest and will help
you improve.

With the basic strength training from Simple & Sinister, you'll be on a good
way. Master the Swing and the Turkish Getup before going any further in your
training.

One thing, though: I did some Turkish Getups with my 24kg kettlebell. I wouldn't
do that again, because my technique seems to have been a bit off, so my knees
hurt the next day. With 24kg above your head, you better know what you're doing.
I'd also say that you don't need 24kg Turkish Getups for "General Prepared
Physique", so keep that to 16kg.

## What to read for kettlebell training?

I really like anything Dan John writes. He has a
[fantastic newsletter](http://danjohn.net/wandering-weights/) and his books are
quite cheap. He breaks things down to the basics and absolutely knows what he's
talking about.
[Pick any book here](https://amazon.de/-/en/Dan-John/e/B0026DJ2AI?ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1&qid=1604173541&sr=8-1).

I've already mentioned Geoff Neupert. Similar to Dan John, he's a down-to-earth
guy. Knowing how life happens, he's keen on providing workouts that fit into
your daily schedule. I've bought several of his ebooks which you'll get by
signing up to his newsletter â€“ e.g. via a free sample like
"[Strength Shortcuts](https://salutis.kartra.com/page/TIV21)". Through his work,
I've started doing double kettlebell workouts (hence two 16kg kettlebells) andâ€¦
well, lots of double front squats are a nice way to keep you humble **and** fit
ðŸ˜…

## Workout ideas

Since writing this, I have settled on some "go to" workouts I can absolutely
recommend once you've nailed the basics:

### Defined sets

- [Humane Burpee](https://danjohn.net/2017/03/humane-burpee/) â€“ five rounds with
  "laddered" squats/pushups:
  - 15 KB Swings + 5 Goblet Squats + 5 Push Ups
  - 15 KB Swings + 4 Goblet Squats + 4 Push Ups
  - 15 KB Swings + 3 Goblet Squats + 3 Push Ups
  - 15 KB Swings + 2 Goblet Squats + 2 Push Ups
  - 15 KB Swings + 1 Goblet Squats + 1 Push Ups
- [The "Perfect" Workout](https://youtu.be/aHQLx_HhFqo) â€“ 3 \* 8 of Half
  Kneeling Press (both sides) + Bar Hang Knee Raises
  - Bulgarian Goat Bag Swings (see the video!) for X minutes â€“ I assume you also
    don't have that crazy hip thrust thingy.
  - 15 Goblet Squat / Overhead Bar Squat combos (amounts to 30 squats in total)
  - Farmer Carry for X minutes per side

### Time based

Do these for ~20 minutes (or however long you want to goâ€¦)

- Double Kettlebell Front Squats, sets of 2 or 3. Rest as needed.
- [Armor Building Complex](https://youtu.be/UyrYmwNWlhQ) (Double Kettlebell: 2x
  Cleans, 1x Press, 3x Front Squats)
  - Do "every minute on the minute" (EMOM) for 20 minutes: 1x Complex per minute
  - Or do as many as you can do with self-paced pauses in between

Have fun, take care of yourself, don't get hurt and **DO** get strong ðŸ’ª
